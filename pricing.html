                    Training at a qualified martial arts school costs around
                    $100-$200 per month, and to reach black belt proficiency
                    usually takes a minimum of 3 years. This means that, at
                    a minimum, a traditional martial arts education will
                    cost about $3,600.

                        "My path of self improvement with GMAU started in
                        October of 2017... I did a lot of internet research
                        to find a martial arts program in my area that would
                        fit into my work and life schedule. I finally
                        discovered that going to a dojo at their posted
                        times was just not an option, but I wanted some kind
                        of program that improved my physical well being,
                        mental discipline and had an enjoyable martial
                        element to it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lighter-color">
                        Finding GMAU and the programs they offer was exactly
                        what I was looking for. I read that once I purchased
                        the bojustu class, I could easily train on my own
                        schedule and train almost anywhere I chose. GMAU is
                        an amazing traveling dojo. A month after I started
                        trading with the bo, I signed up for the Shotokan
                        Karate course.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lighter-color">
                        Since I began training almost a year ago, I have
                        noticed an increase in muscle mass (my wife has
                        noticed too), an increase in my body awareness, a
                        stronger core and greater flexibility. In years
                        past, when I had â€˜down timeâ€™ my job, I felt I had
                        wasted it by not including a physical activity
                        component to my day. Now, I have no â€˜down timeâ€™ at
                        work, I have a training regimen that is serving me
                        very well."

                        Martial Arts University. I had always wanted to
                        study Shotokan Karate, and through life's twists and
                        turns, never had the opportunity. Two years ago,
                        after moving to Texas and discovering that there
                        were no local dojoâ€™s that I could attend that would
                        fit my schedule, I started searching online. I came
                        across Global Martial Arts University and couldnâ€™t
                        have been happier. Not only am I able to train and
                        earn real rank through GMAU, but I can train
                        anywhere, anytime, on my own schedule! Not to
                        mention that the guidance and one on one instruction
                        from Sensei John and Sensei Michael, is something

                    â€” <strong>For Taekwondo:</strong> Film yourself
                    demonstrating all poomsae in the syllabus up to your
                    current rank. You must have rank in WTF taekwondo to
                    transfer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your instructor will do a detailed review of your
                    transfer rank video. If you are up to our standards of
                    rank equivalency, we will honor your current rank, and
                    you can keep training toward your black belt and beyond.
